# Trivial space sketches

Trivial space started as an art project back in 2012 to explore the
possibilities of current web technologies as presentation platform for virtual
art spaces.

Since a first prototype and exhibition in 2013, the main focus shifted to
improve the technical workflow for creating and developing such virtual spaces.
During a long research and learning period, some interconnected programming
libraries and tools evolved, that improve the creation of web based virtual
reality by code. Together they enable a development environment for WebGL
scenes, with hot code and shader reloading as well as application and WebGL
state preservation in live coding sessions.

This workflow builds on following libraries:

- [Painter](https://github.com/trivial-space/painter), a WebGL rendering engine
  tweaked for live coding / hot reloading.
- [Libs](https://github.com/trivial-space/libs), a collection of useful
  functions and helpers.
- [Libs-wasm](https://github.com/trivial-space/trivalibs-rs), collection of rust
  utilities for creative coding and geometric alorithms targeting web assembly.

This is the primary repository for trivial space sketches. Experiments and works
are build here, while working both on the programming tools as well as on
artistic expressions.

Basically everything here is work in progress. Intermediate results are
published to [sketches.trivialspace.net](https://sketches.trivialspace.net),
which is just a statically hosted version of the `public` folder of this
repository.

A curated selection of sketches is presented at the
[trivial space](https://www.trivialspace.net) website.

## Local development

To install the playground locally and play with the sketches, clone this
repository, and run

    npm run git-init
    npm run install
    npm run dev

The drafts within a live coding environment will be available at
`localhost:8000`.

### Building and watching wasm rust crates

To build a create once run `npx wasm-pack build --target web path/to/crate`

To watch and rebuild a create on rust file changes run
`npm run wasm path/to/crate`
